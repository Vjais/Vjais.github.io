  <p class="yz"><font style ="color:white">This project is focused on Augmented Reality at the table-top scale. In the future when everyone is wearing their AR enabled eye-wear most of the time, what kind of future will it be? Will it be a glorious information-rich world or an advertising nightmare. We are going to explore this a bit by looking into what breakfast might become in this new world. Right now you may have a place mat, a box of cereal, a carton of milk, a can of juice, each with their own graphics, but what if those objects were to be more aggressive in trying to get your attention? Or, what if the place mat was trying to get you to eat healthy by giving you the nutritional information on what you are eating?
