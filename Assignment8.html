  <h2 class="xyz"><u></ul><font style ="color:#F4976C">IKEA PLACE Review</font></u></h2>
  <p class="yz"><font style ="color:grey">
       This week I had a chance to test another augmented reality application.It is the IKEA PLACE.This application allows the user to experiment with furniture through the app by placing it at any place they prefer.The user just have to install the application and select the furniture of their choice from the list.After choosing the furniture,the application access the camera and places the furniture in the desired surrounding.The user can also remove and replace the furniture if they don't find it suitableIf they find it suitable they can create a list of favourite furniture.A more better explaination is in the images below.The first image I took at library by placing a sofa set which kind of fits in the scenario.The next picture I took at home by placing a table in the hall.</font></p>

      <br>
  <p class="yz"><font style ="color:grey">Initially I will like to review the application.It is a user friendly application.It begins with text that explains working of application so that user does not gets confused.It worked very smoothly throughout the experiment.However,after the furniture is selected it takes few seconds to load on the screen.Second issue which I found is the option of resizing the furniture.The user has to move to and fro to adjust the size.In future,the option to drag and drop can be added to make whole process easier.Another good option could be using filters so that user can know how it will look with different kind of light.</font></p>     

<p class="yz"><font style ="color:grey">The application makes utilization of ARcore augmented reality platform developed by google and ARkit platform developed by Apple.The tracking feature is fast and accurate.The auto scaling feature adds more interaction.The minimal functionality and aesthetically pleasing interface makes it more easy to use for every individual.The underlying AR technology makes it very useful and powerful apllication. </font></p>    
<p class="yz"><font style ="color:grey">These kind of application are very useful for marketing and sales of product.It also gives an advantage to user to experiment with the product and be satisfied before purchasing the product.Personally,I would prefer to have these kind of applications in future.The reason is that firstly it saves time as you can filter out the product according to own choice within the budget range.Secondly,it gives advantage to go through the catalogue of products  which are sometimes not available in the store.Thirdly it gives an idea about the product how close it would appear  to the real one.Fourthly,it also reduces several cost involved while purchasing the product.Hence,I would prefer to have more application which provides these advantages.</font></p>    
<p class="yz"><font style ="color:grey">Definitely,these kind of application gives a leverage not only in e-commerce but to other fields as well.In fact many similar application are being introduced in the market.In the future,I would like to see more application in the field of aviation in order to explain the safety instructions,in medical fiels to train the interns,in fashion industry to get an idea of design or help scientists in visualization of their research.As we walk into a new era,more application are encouraged that would be beneficial in day to day life.Certainly it would give rise to more innovative products in future.</font></p>
