     For the fifth and sixth assignment we have to review two project of our peers in this course that we found interesting during the demo.I reviewed many projects and personally liked something in all of them.
    The first project that I have reviewed is of team6 Mantovani.The reason for choosing his project is the unique models he has chosen for the targets and the way those are placed around targets.Each scene somehow presents some kind of story.On the placemat,all the models are placed on the edges.First of all is the spokesperson on placemat is well choosen as it goes with the surrounding objects.The next is the objects on placed on the edges of the placemat.There are many 3d objects that depict it is a breakfast scene.Although,the models are chosen sensibly but the colour of plates doesn’t suits the base mat.The reason is that the base mat is black and white and the plate is white hence it gets absorbed.
    The next thing that I liked are cereal boxes.On the first cereal box, the first thing to notice is the title mad hats and appropriate description of the nutritional values.The objects do justify the title.The most attention seeking part is the animation on the cereal box.There are two things that I would like to mention for the animation, firstly it explains the title very well and looks great on the cereal box.The second thing is after few seconds it gives a sense of sickness.The cereal bowl and spoon is a good idea but then the colour somehow again gets absorbed.I really appreciate the hat that he made himself.It suits the madman and is very smooth.The scissor is also good with the theme but again the size makes it kind of invisible.It could have been placed on the hand of madhatter.
    I really liked the next cereal (Smokey os cereal box) box.The first thing I noticed is the animated cat hat which is quite humorous.The next most noticeable thing is the cereals coming out of the box.The effects are perfectly reflected on the box.On one of the side of cereal box, the model appears to slide out of cereal box.It looks real even though it’s static.The next object on the box are mushrooms which again looks appeasing.
    The next target i.e cans is designed very cleverly.The idea of placing cards as handles of the drink is again very cool.The effects around the can don’t cancel each other and are well observable.The banner above the can is interesting in itself. The spokesperson and the animation on it is also a wise thought. Overall all the models properly justify the title which is aced tea.
