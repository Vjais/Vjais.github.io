       For the fifth and sixth assignment we have to review two project of our peers in this course that we found interesting during the demo.I reviewed many projects and personally liked something in all of them.

      <br>
    
			
      The first project that I have reviewed is of team6 Mantovani.The reason for choosing his project is the unique models he has chosen for the targets and the way those are placed around targets.On the placemat, all the models are placed on the edges.First of all is the spokesperson on placemat is well choosen as it goes with the surrounding objects.The next is the objects on placed on the edges of the placemat.There are many 3d objects that depict it is a breakfast scene.Although,the models are chosen sensibly but the colour of plates doesnâ€™t suits the base mat.The reason is that the base mat is black and white and the plate is white hence it gets absorbed.
      The next thing that I liked are cereal boxes.On the first cereal box, the first thing to notice is the title mad hats and appropriate description of the nutritional values.The objects do justify the title.The most attention seeking part is the animation on the cereal box.There are two things that I would like to mention for the animation,firstly it explains the title very well and looks great on the cereal box.The second thing is after few seconds it gives a sense of sickness.
