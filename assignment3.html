			Google Translate is one of the amazing application developed by google.It translates texts,images,audio etc from one language to another using long short term memory network algorithm.It supports around 100 languages on both Android and IOS.Let's have a first look at google translator through the image below .

      Now deciphering some strange storefronts or foreign menu is not difficult task.All you have to do is click a picture or type in the words and the more cooler feature is to record the audio and get answered within seconds.Along with this,it also gives user flexibility to download the language and use it offline.As soon as you give the input,it tries to detect the language and then translate it.As per this assignment,we had to find something in a foreign language in the real world.Let's begin with the first sample below.

      The first image is of hand written sample written in italian.I tried to translate it into english by typing italian text in the google translate text area.Within a matter of few seconds got the result in english.The processing speed was quick in this case.The accuracy of detection was correct.Let's check the second sample below.

     The above sample is a cover of chinese sweet called White Rabbit.I clicked a picture of front side and back side of cover that was written in chinese and turned it into a collage.On testing with google translate application,initially it tried to detect the language.For the front side,there was time lag in deciphering the text but eventually it was correct.The back side of the cover was detected quickly.After this experiment,my conclusion was that there is requirement for further improvement in few translations.Some words were guessed incorrectly.
