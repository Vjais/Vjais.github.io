			Google Translate is one of the great open source application developed by google.It translates texts,images,audio etc from one language to another using long short term memory network algorithm.It supports around 100 languages on both Android and IOS.Let's have a first look at google translator through the image below .

      Now deciphering some strange storefronts or foreign menu is not difficult task anymore.All you have to do is click a picture or type in the words and the more cooler feature is to record the audio and get answers within seconds.Along with this,it also gives user flexibility to download the language and use it offline.As soon as you give the input,it tries to detect the language and then translate it into preferred language.As per this assignment,we had to find something in a foreign language in the real world.Let's begin with the first sample below.

      The first image is of hand written sample in italian language.I tried to translate it into english by typing italian text in the google translate text area.Within a matter of few seconds got the result in english.The processing speed was quick in this case.The accuracy of detection was correct.Let's check the second sample below.

     The above sample is a cover of chinese sweet called White Rabbit.I clicked a picture of front side and back side of cover that was written in chinese and turned it into a collage.On testing with google translate application,initially it tried to detect the language.For the front side,there was time lag in deciphering the text but eventually it was correct.The back side of the cover was detected quickly.After this experiment,my conclusion was that although it does the job but still there is requirement for further improvement in few translations.Some words were guessed incorrectly.

 <h2 class="yyz"><font style ="color:#0731ba">FUTURE UTILIZATION OF GOOGLE TRANSLATE IN AUGMENTED REALITY DEVICES</font></h2>
 <hr>
 <p class="yz">
    <font style ="color:white">
     In future more languages will be covered by google translate,it will give more advantage to AR devices.It will expand the application to many fields.The first and foremost application would be ease of language barrier among travellers,understanding clients with different nationality in offices,understanding songs in different language.It will also expediate the learning experience of a new language.Especially for kids,it will be more fun and can be expected to give rise to educational games.I also assume it will also detect multiple language in a single sentence in future without rendering the actual meaning from users prospective.Another assumption which slightly differs from the context is that the future AR devices would also decipher the languages other than human for example pets.
     Depending upon volume of text in future,the realitive translation is expected to be error free that is grammatically correct and relatively fast.Since the faulty translation would mislead the user and create chaos.
     In my view,the user should excercise control to certain level till it's essential.
