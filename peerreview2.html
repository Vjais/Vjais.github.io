  <p class="yz"><font style ="color:white">For this week,we have to review two student's choice that were presented during week 12 and 13.My second choice for the review is <a class="xna" href="https://appadvice.com/app/ar-runner/1275938861">AR Runner</a> presented by Sai Phaltankar.Augmented reality has been changing the phase of android application by blending the digital and real worlds by using your camera lens.The user can find these applications intriguing as it allows user to interact in real time.The embedding of augmented reality with android and ios applications have given rise to some very cool applications.As AR applications are evolving,one of such interesting application is AR runnner.It is interesting in a way that it encourages player to workout and is also a good source of entertainment.</font></p> 
  <p class="yz"><font style ="color:white"></font>AR runner is a augmented reality mobile game developed by <a class="xna" href="http://semido.me/">Semidome Inc.</a>

  In this game,the player has to move around in the surrounding.It is a free application available on iOS App Store.All you need to do is install the application on your device.The application initially scans the area select by the player and then set the track with checkpoints in the application.The image below shows the track built after scan.The player has to quickly cover these checkpoints.There are two editions of this game i.e a free edition and a premium edition.It can be played in both the modes as single or multiplayer.The free version has four different versions.The first version is Normal mode which has the simply has the track.The second mode is 30 Second Rush,the player has to cover certain checkpoints within 30 seconds.The third version is Enemies,the player has to avoid enemies hitting the checkpoints.The fouth version is wall punch that is to activate the most number of circles by moving your device through them.The premium version of the game offers two new field shapes and two additional modes.There is also statistics available which compares the progress with the other players through the leaderboard.There are also in built challanges that player can select accordingly.</p>

 <p class="yz"><font style ="color:white">The idea behind this application is to encourages the user to go outdoors.It completely involves physical activity and also keeps the player concentrated by guiding through checkpoints.It works smoothly without any lag.It's especially helpful to people who procrastinate and are lazy enough to do excercise.For the new generation,it is definitely very helful.It is one of stress busting application and also best utilization of time.The minimal deign and simplicity is what makes it novel from other games.It is open to all kind of age groups hence no age bar.The challenges in the game keeps the player motivated to target for next round.Few instructions and guidelines makes it easy to understand.The multiplayer mode makes it more interesting.The leaderboard helps the player to compare the results with self and other users and it comes with photo mode i.e Take a photo of your score using the in-game camera.It can be friendly and competetive for some users.This application is an epitome of interaction and utilization of outer space.Fitness enthusiasts find this application very accommodating.The premium version is just for $2 which is really inexpensive and a good deal.Hence more users are unlocking the premium version.Even though it is mostly designed for outdoors but it can be played indoors as well.</font></p>
 <p class="yz"><font style ="color:white">There are few downside of this application.Although,it is good outdoor application but too much concentration on application can be dangerous and might hurt the user.It only shows the front side of the surrounding due to which user becomes unaware of the movement in the rest of the surrounding.This application is only limited to iphone users which is a major disadvantage.It can be more accessible if it is introduced to other platforms as well.Overall,it is a great application.According to macworld-"Itâ€™s short, fast, active fun, and an inventive use of ARKit.".In future,I hope there will be more such interesting applications making best use of augmented reality.</font></p>
