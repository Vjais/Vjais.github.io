  <h2 class="xyz"><u></ul><font style ="color:#0FDDAF">Choice 2:AR Runner</font></u></h2>
  <p class="yz"><font style ="color:white">For this week,we have to review two student's choice that were presented during week 12 and 13.My second choice for the review is <a class="xna" href="https://appadvice.com/app/ar-runner/1275938861">AR Runner</a> presented by Sai Phaltankar.Augmented reality has been changing the phase of android application by blending the digital and real worlds by using your camera lens.The user can find these applications intriguing as it allows user to interact in real time.The embedding of augmented reality with android and ios applications have given rise to some very cool applications.As AR applications are evolving,one of such interesting application is AR runnner.


<!-- While it has been around for a while, augmented reality has recently become mainstream with tech giants like Apple and Google pushing it forward with technologies like ARKit (Apple) and ARCore (Google). All you need is your smartphone with the latest iOS or Android versions installed and you’re good to experience the myriad of augmented reality applications now available. There are over 2,000 AR apps available in iOS App Store and another 200-plus on Google Play. With few breakout hits, many are wondering what the killer use cases for AR will be. We can examine the growth of the mobile app ecosystem to better understand how mobile AR will evolve. 

    AR Runner uses this technology as the foundation for its game to get you moving, no matter where you are. Open the app and select the size and shape of the playing field you want, based on your environment. Once that's done, the game will scan the area you've selected and set up a course for you.

From there, look at your phone's screen and hit the checkpoints it suggests as quickly as you can. The free version of this game gives you two types of courses — one in which you have to hit checkpoints in a certain order and another asking you to "punch" through hoops.

The game allows you to play in a single-player mode or with others as you pass the device between you. It also lets you compare your times against all AR Runner players, in case your competitive spirit goes beyond the immediate area. A premium purchase, at a price of $2, gets you two additional game modes, a larger playing field option and different course shapes. One more thought: Do be careful while running that you don't focus too heavily on your screen. There's a risk that you'll trip and fall. It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt, after all.AR Runner does this pretty well. The idea is simple: There are a bunch of dots in front of you that you must run toward. Once you get there, it gives you another dot. You see how fast you can go, and your score is put up on the leaderboards. Sure, running with your phone out in front of you isn't ideal - it'll be much better once we have glasses - but it's so simple it's addicting. Plus, it's a blast with friends. The more complicated paths are locked behind in-app purchases though. --></font></p>
