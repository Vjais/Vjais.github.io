  <h3 class="xyz"><font style ="color:white"><u>Initial thought on applications :</font></u></font></h3>

	
	<p class="yz"><font style ="color:white">This week,I got a chance to explore the sky using some amazing applications.As complex the word astronomy sounds it's more hard to imagine the celestial bodies.The invent of modern technologies has given rise to certain application which has given a direction to these unimaginable things.Some of few application are available on smartphones that provides window to universe. </font>
	</p>

  <p class="yz"><font style ="color:white">For this assignment,I tried three different applications.The first application that I tried was Skyview(middle image).This application gives a real time 360 degree magnified view of Planets, stars, constellations, and satellites on your phone screen using sensors.It is quite an engaging application.Asthetically it is very pleasing and soothing for eyes.The sound feature intensifies the experience.On tapping the stars or planet,certain information(fun fact) pops up on screen.The features that impressed me the most was the in-build compass that also reminds of the direction the user is moving and time travel so that user can track activities that happened in the past.Also user can click picture and record video as well.The only part which is bit odd is absence of freedom to move around objects manually.</font>

    <img src="https://github.com/Vjais/Vjais.github.io/blob/master/skymaps.jpeg?raw=true"  width="400" height="400"></div>

    
 
   <p class="yz"><font style ="color:white">The next application that I tried was StarTracker(first image).The interface gives full immersion.The user can zoom through out the application.It has allmost same features as skyview.It also comes with feature to locate object on the map.The downside of this application was that it's interface is too bright that can be irritating for eyes in case one uses it for long time.Secondly,the lack of more information about the objects.</font>
  </p>

  <p class="yz"><font style ="color:white">The next application that I tried was SkyMaps an open source project by Google(last image).This application is simple in comparision to other two applications.But it covers the disadvantages of both.User can use it for long time without any discomfort.The best part about this application is freedom to add and remove objects.This makes application adds more flexibility for users.It's simplicity and features makes it more appeasing.In future,the features take picture can be added.</font>

  <h2 class="yyz"><font style ="color:#F1C40F">FUTURE INTEGRATION IN AR GLASSES</font></h2>
 <hr>
 <p class="yz"><font style ="color:white">Merely the thought of integration of such applications in AR glasses is quite exciting.The experience would be very impactful.The flexibility to look at the sky using glasses and getting certain information will be very useful.After experimenting with the above applications,my imagination is that initially there should be an option to choose the setting(bright or simple) in which user comfortably gaze the sky.The voice recognition feature  and the gesture feature will augment the experience.A bot that would serve as a guide using audio would make it more interactive.</font>
  </p>

 <p class="yz"><font style ="color:white">In my view,the data source that I would prefer to be added in future will be integration with google maps.The reason is that the user keeps a track of what's ahead to reduce the risk of accidents by having the idea of surroundings.Another would be adding more objects so that it provides more information to the user.Additionally,I would also like to see the feature that gives information such as short history,current temperature,distance from the user etc to be added in future.  </font>
  </p> 
   
  <p class="yz"><font style ="color:white">In future with the advancement of technology,adding such applications would be a great experience.The application would be beneficial from several prospects example for educational purpose.Overall,with the addition of these layers of data the future would look more innovative. </font>
